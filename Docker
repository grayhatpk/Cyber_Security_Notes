----------What is the Docker------------
We can package an application into an image and can run it any where virtually. The Image file contains everything the application needs to run.  
Dockerizing the application means we add the docker file which contains instructions to docker to package an application into an image. 

Docker file contians all the insturction which are needed for the dockerizing an application. 

To run the ubuntu image, we can use the command 
 docker run ubuntu
